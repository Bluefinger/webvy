# Webvy - A Bevy Powered Static Site Generator

Currently a MASSIVE WIP, a lot of stuff still in flux and heavy in development. Use at your own risk, as it is currently stupidly barebones and incomplete.

## Supported Versions & MSRV

`webvy` uses the same MSRV as `bevy`. Currently it is using the latest stable Bevy version, though might switch to git/main version if in need of newer features whilst still in development prior to a more fleshed out release.
